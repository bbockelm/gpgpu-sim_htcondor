GPGPU-Sim on HTCondor Examples
==============================

Example 1: backprop
-------------------

The example in the `backprop` sub-directory is a short exercise
in running the `backprop` benchmark from the Rodina benchmark
suite within GPGPU-Sim.  It is a relatively short-running
executable.

Example 2: parboil-cutcp
------------------------

The example in the `parboil` sub-directory is a short exercise
in running the `parboil-cutcp` benchmark within GPGPU-Sim.
The configuration of `parboil-cutcp` provided will take 6-7
hours to run within CHTC.

Advanced - Building GPGPU-Sim
-----------------------------
For information on how to create a build of GPGPU-Sim that is
equivalent to the one we's used in these exercises, see the
`build_instructions` sub-directory.
